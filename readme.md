# What the Extension Does

This Chrome extension allows users to filter videos on YouTube based on specific topics or languages.

## Features

### Topic Filtering
- Users can input one or more keywords (topics), and the extension will hide videos whose titles or channel names do not match the specified topics.

### Language Filtering
- Users can select a preferred language (e.g., Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Hindi, etc.) from a dropdown list.
- The extension will detect the language in video titles and channel names and filter videos accordingly.

### Combined Filtering
- The filtering works on an **OR condition**:
  - A video will remain visible if it matches either a specified topic **or** the selected language.

### Dynamic Content Handling
- The extension continuously monitors YouTube's dynamically loaded content (e.g., infinite scrolling) to apply the filters in real time.
